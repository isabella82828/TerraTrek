# TerraTrek

🗺️ TerraTrek is a voice-controlled globe that combines software and hardware components to process voice commands and provide interesting facts about a given geographic location. It fosters global awareness and promotes cultural curiosity by making geographical concepts more tangible. 

🕹️ Using the Raspberry Pi and Porcupine API, it detects the specific wake phrase, “Hey TerraTrek.” The Google Speech Recognition API converts speech to text, and the Google Maps API gathers the coordinates of the location. Next, the Arduino with stepper and servo motors rotates and tilts the globe to the specified location, and the ChatGPT API generates interesting facts about the location.
